# FreeRise
## A freelance platform. 
The main idea of the project is to provide freelancers in the IT environment, in Bulgaria, an easy to use, interactive platform in which they can polish their skills and increase their professional experience.
The project will also provide clients with a comfortable place, in which they can look for a developer that suits their needs, to whom they may can outsource their project. 
The platform’s target will not be only Bulgarian freelancers, but that will be the starting point.
The platform’s target will only be IT freelancers.

The clients have no means of:
•	Determining if they can afford to hire a freelancer, without establishing contact with him first.
•	Determining, if a freelancer has the needed knowledge, without establishing contact with him first.
•	Determining if a freelancer is reliable. Most of the times they are forced to make a blind shot.
•	Easy and interactive categorizing, sorting, filtering or searching for a particular service, let alone provider.
The freelancers have no means of:
•	Actively advertising themselves, without manually doing so.
•	Positioning themselves, as reliable providers of particular services.
•	Interactively providing information about their professional experience and previously finished projects.
•	Easy and interactive categorizing, sorting, filtering or searching for particular projects, let alone clients.
This project aims to eliminate these issues, and many more, and provide an easy to use, and comfortable for both sides – platform.
